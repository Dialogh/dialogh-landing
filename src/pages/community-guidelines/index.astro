          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Welcome to Dialogh</h2>
          <p>
            Dialogh is a space for developers, designers, and thinkers to collaborate,
            learn, and grow together. To maintain a positive and productive environment
            for everyone, we've established these community guidelines.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Community-Driven Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            Dialogh operates on a principle of trust and autonomy. Our founders, co-founders,
            and moderators are here when moderation is needed—but otherwise, this community
            belongs to you. You're free to initiate discussions, organize events, start projects,
            and take the lead on initiatives without waiting for permission.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            We believe in empowering members to shape the community. If you have an idea
            for a workshop, a project collaboration, or a community event, go ahead and
            make it happen. The leadership team is here to support you, not to gatekeep.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Be Respectful</h2>
          <p>
            Treat all members with respect and kindness. We embrace diverse perspectives,
            backgrounds, and skill levels. Harassment, discrimination, hate speech, or
            personal attacks of any kind will not be tolerated.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Criticism vs. Bullying</h2>
          <p>
            We actively encourage healthy criticism and debate—it's how we all get better.
            Challenge ideas, point out flaws in logic, question approaches, and offer
            alternative perspectives. Robust technical discussions make us sharper.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            However, there's a clear line between criticism and bullying. Criticism targets
            ideas, work, or arguments. Bullying targets the person. You can say "this approach
            has performance issues because..." but not "you're incompetent for choosing this."
            Critique the code, the design, the concept—never attack the individual.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Repeated negative targeting of an individual, dismissive language, mockery,
            or making someone feel unwelcome crosses into bullying territory and won't
            be tolerated. When in doubt: critique with specificity, offer alternatives,
            and assume the other person is trying their best.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Share Thoughtfully</h2>
          <p>
            Share content that adds value to the community—whether it's your work,
            interesting resources, or questions that spark meaningful discussion.
            Avoid spam, excessive self-promotion, or irrelevant content. Quality
            over quantity.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Help Each Other</h2>
          <p>
            One of our core values is collaboration. If someone asks a question
            and you can help, jump in. Share your knowledge, experiences, and resources
            generously. We all started somewhere, and helping others helps the entire
            community grow.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Take Initiative</h2>
          <p>
            Want to host a workshop? Start a study group? Launch a collaborative project?
            Organize a code review session? Do it. You don't need approval from leadership
            to make things happen in this community.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Share your plans in the community, rally people who are interested, and execute.
            The moderators are here to help if you need resources, promotion, or support—but
            the power to create and lead is in your hands. This is your community as much
            as it is anyone else's.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Keep Conversations On Topic</h2>
          <p>
            Use appropriate channels for different types of discussions. This helps
            everyone find what they're looking for and keeps conversations organized.
            If you're unsure where to post something, ask a moderator.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Respect Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Don't share others' personal information without permission. What happens
            in Dialogh stays in Dialogh unless explicitly stated otherwise. Be mindful
            of confidentiality when discussing projects or sharing screenshots.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Give Credit</h2>
          <p>
            When sharing work, resources, or ideas that aren't yours, give proper
            attribution. Plagiarism and copyright infringement aren't just unethical—they
            undermine the collaborative spirit of our community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">The Role of Moderators</h2>
          <p>
            Our founders, co-founders, and moderators aren't here to control the community—they're
            here to intervene only when necessary. Think of them as a safety net, not a ceiling.
            They step in to handle conflicts, address guideline violations, and ensure the
            space remains safe and welcoming.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Most of the time, you won't need them. The community is self-governing, and we
            trust members to interact respectfully and productively. Leadership is here to
            support your initiatives, mediate when things go sideways, and maintain the
            infrastructure—but the day-to-day energy and direction come from you.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Report Issues</h2>
          <p>
            If you encounter behavior that violates these guidelines or makes you
            uncomfortable, please report it to our moderators. We take all reports
            seriously and will handle them with discretion. Don't hesitate to reach
            out—your comfort and safety matter.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Consequences</h2>
          <p>
            Violations of these guidelines may result in warnings, temporary suspension,
            or permanent removal from the community, depending on the severity and
            frequency of the behavior. Our goal is to maintain a safe, welcoming space
            for everyone.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-8">
          <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-secondary mb-4">Final Note</h2>
          <p>
            These guidelines exist to create a foundation of mutual respect and trust,
            not to limit your freedom or creativity. We want Dialogh to be a place where
            you feel empowered to experiment, learn publicly, fail safely, and grow alongside
            others who share your passion.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Challenge each other's ideas fiercely. Collaborate generously. Lead without
            waiting for permission. Support those who are learning. And above all, remember
            that behind every username is a real person trying to build something meaningful.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Let's make Dialogh a place where great ideas flourish, meaningful connections
            are made, and everyone has the space to become the creator they aspire to be.
