        <p class="py-6 text-base sm:text-lg">We’re for:</p>

        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg">
          → Developers who think beyond code <br /> → Designers who care about clarity
          over trends <br /> → Builders who value ideas, not just output <br /> →
          Learners who ask real questions <br /> → Anyone who wants to grow in public,
          with intention
          <br />
          <br />
          You don’t need to be “ready” — you just need to show up. Everything else
          builds from there.
